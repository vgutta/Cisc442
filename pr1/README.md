I used jupyter notebook for development, incase if you don't have that enviroment on your computer I am
attaching this link http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vgutta/Cisc442/blob/master/pr1/Part1.ipynb
which should show you a copy of my notebook which inludes all the outputs inline

You can also cd into part1 and run "python3 Part1.py" to get the output images which are written to image files as output
